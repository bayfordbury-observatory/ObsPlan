# ObsPlan

ObsPlan is a batch tool for planning observations at Bayfordbury, designed to supplement the target checker on our website.

You can provide a list of targets, then specify a date range, and it will generate observability plots for all the requested targets and dates.

The current version has limited functionality, so it only works for deep sky objects. A future version will support Solar System objects (planets, asteroids & comets). 

You can download it from the [releases page.](https://github.com/bayfordbury-observatory/ObsPlan/releases) Please send us any feedback or suggestions!

## Using ObsPlan-DSO.py

### Requirements

You must install the following Python packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- astropy
- astroplan
- astroquery

### Targets

Firstly, you must provide a list of targets. These should be listed in `targets.txt`, which needs to be in the same directory as `ObsPlan-DSO.py`.

`targets.txt` should have one target name per line. An example file is provided with pre-filled targets. 

Target names should be resolvable by SIMBAD, for example:
- M31
- Vega
- BD+26 2245
- 2MASS J11404947+2530339
- Gaia DR3 4005347343309786112
- HD 48915

Raw coordinates (RA and dec) are not accepted.

### Dates
Once you have created a target list, you must edit `ObsPlan-DSO.py` to specify the date range you want to generate plots for. Near the start of the file you should see:

```
start_date = "2025-03-01 12:00"
end_date = "2025-05-01 12:00" 
step_size = 7  # Days
```

This will create an airmass plot and parameter table for every 7th night from 2025-03-01 to 2025-05-01. If you change it to `step_size = 1`, it will generate a plot for every night. This is OK for short date ranges, but for longer ranges (>1 month), it is sensible to increase the step size. Otherwise, the script will take a long time to run and you will have hundreds of plots to sort through. 

Edit `start_date` and `end_date`, changing the dates but keeping the time at 12:00. Once you have done this, you are ready to run the code.

### Running the code

Once you have updated `targets.txt` and updated the dates and step sizes, you can run the script (e.g.  `python ObsPlan-DSO.py`). Make sure you are running the script from the directory containing `targets.txt `, and be aware that your plots will appear in the same directory. 

Depending on the number of targets and dates, it may take a while to run (usually a few seconds per date). 

If you are running Python in an interactive environment (e.g. Jupyter), you will see the plots appearing as they generate. In any case, the plots will be saved within a folder named `plots`. Inside that folder, a new subfolder will be created every time you run ObsPlan. This is to prevent accidentally overwriting previous outputs, or getting mixed up between different sets of targets and dates. 

Please be aware that the `plots` folder can grow in size very quickly if you run ObsPlan over a large number of dates, or re-run the script many times. 

### Interpreting results

Below is an example of an airmass plot generated by ObsPlan-DSO. It shows the altitude & airmass for four visible targets on the night of 2025-11-03. If any targets are not visible on a given night, they will not appear on the plot.

Airmass plots will always include the altitude of the moon, but you must also consider that its altitude is only part of the story; moon phase (i.e. lunar illumination) and target separation are also very important. 

The bands of colour in the background correspond to daytime (yellow), civil twilight (light blue), nautical twilight (blue), astronomical twilight (dark blue), and night (black). 

You should observe targets when they are at their highest, and generally you should not observe below 30°. You will also need to consider the telescope horizon limits, which the target checker tool can show you (this may be implemented in future version of this script).

Each airmass plot has a corresponding information table, shown below. For each given night, this table will tell you how long the target will be visible for, the highest altitude it will reach, an estimated V-band magnitude (from SIMBAD), and its separation from the moon. The brighter the moon is, the more it will affect the sky background for targets near it. For example, targets within 40° of a full moon should be avoided. Remember to pay attention to when the moon rises and sets, as it can only affect your targets when it is above the horizon.

For this example, assuming the observations are taking place during an observing practical (7pm - 9pm UTC), the best targets are Vega and IC5070. M31 would be a poor target because is quite close to the moon, which is very bright on this night. HD 48915 is too low, and rises after the practical has finished.  

If both Vega and IC5070 need to be observed, then it would be sensible to observe Vega first, as it will reach a high airmass (=low altitude) by the end of the pracitcal, while IC5070 will be remain at a relatively low airmass (=high altitude) near the end of the practical. 

Finally, the script will generate one more plot called `visibility_duration.png`. This plot shows you how many hours each target is visible for over the full date range you entered, which is useful for long-term planning and special projects.
