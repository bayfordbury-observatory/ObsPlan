# ObsPlan

ObsPlan is a batch tool for planning observations at Bayfordbury, designed to supplement the target checker on our website.

You can provide a list of targets, and specify a date range, then it will generate airmass plots for all of the requested targets and dates.

The current version has limited functionality, so it only works for deep sky objects. A future version will support Solar System objects (planets, asteroids & comets).

You can download it from the [releases page.](https://github.com/bayfordbury-observatory/ObsPlan/releases)
